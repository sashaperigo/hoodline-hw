        <h1>Regional trends in start-up culture</h1>
        <div class="byline">

        <p>The advent of venture capital has brought an explosion of startup culture in the United States in the last 30 years. In 2018 <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-20/startups-hustle-to-raise-cash-before-recession-strikes">startups raised a collective $96 billion</a>, an astounding height on par with investment in the dot-com era.</p>
        <p>Early growth of the tech industry was largely constrained to a handful of areas including San Francisco, Seattle, and New York, but this trend is shifting as investors explore untapped markets. <a href="http://technet.org/blog/how-the-startup-economy-is-spreading-across-the-country">The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported</a> that in 2015 and 2016 the creation of new companies accelerated not just in major metropolitan areas but in smaller cities. <a href="http://technet.org/blog/how-the-startup-economy-is-spreading-across-the-country">More companies are describing themselves as “startups”</a> in online job postings than ever before.</p>

        <p>Data from Crunchbase shows that Boston and Los Angeles both had significantly more startups raising funding in mid-2018 than traditional tech metro Seattle. Durham, North Carolina is also a notable addition to this list; Over 60 startups received funding in mid-2018 in the city of 250,000.</p>
        <p>As startup culture has taken root in cities across the United States, each region has taken its own spin on the industry. In some regions, the tech startups of today have taken inspiration from established industries in the region. It might not come as a surprise that New York City has a disproportionate amount of <strong>Fashion</strong> startups, or that Los Angeles is home to many <strong>Media and Entertainment</strong> companies. In other cities popular industries track existing cultural trends. The fact that Denver is home to a significant amount of <strong>Cannabis</strong> startups may have something to do with the fact that Colorado led the nation in legalizing recreational use of the drug. In other regions still, growing industries have attracted job seekers from other areas and subsequently transformed local culture.</p>

        <h2>Health Care and the Midwest</h2>
        <p>Investors are keen to invest in the health care industry right now, and these days it seems like there's no better place to do so than the Midwest. <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/11/29/5-midwest-startup-trends-2018/">Nearly 60% of the 50 largest funding rounds</a> closed in the Midwest in 2018 were in the Health Care industry. Cincinnati's <a href="http://patientpoint.com/">PatientPoint</a>, Minneapolis-based <a href="https://brighthealthplan.com/">BrightHealth</a>, and Chicago's <a href="https://www.outcomehealth.com/">Outcome Health</a> and <a href="https://www.tempus.com/">Tempus</a> were some of the biggest fundraisers in the region.</p>
        <p>In some respects, it's not surprising that the Midwest has attracted a disproportionate amount of Health Care industry investment. The Midwest is home to some of the best hospitals in the country. Mayo Clinic in Minnesota and Cleveland Clinic in Ohio earned the top two spots on <a href="https://health.usnews.com/best-hospitals">this year's U.S. News ranking</a> of best hospitals.</p>
        <p>The influx of investment in the Health Care industry could also be a positive signal that some struggling Midwestern economies could turn around. Driven by widespread lack of employment and a burgeoning opiod crisis, <a href="http://www.wvxu.org/post/ohio-ranks-no-6-list-most-moved-states-2018#stream/0">Ohio ranked highly</a> on the list of most moved-from states in 2018. <a href="http://www.wvxu.org/post/ohio-ranks-no-6-list-most-moved-states-2018#stream/0">Over 60%</a> of those leaving cite lack of job opportunities as their biggest complaint. Likewise, <a href="https://www.ibj.com/articles/71770-report-finds-central-indiana-faces-dearth-of-good-jobsso-oneamerica-raises-its-salaries">a recent study from the Brookings Institute</a> found that Central Indiana has a shortage of quality, middle-class jobs. Economist Michael Stoll at the University of California Los Angeles points to Philadelphia and Pittsburgh as examples for Cleveland, <a href="http://www.wvxu.org/post/ohio-ranks-no-6-list-most-moved-states-2018#stream/0">They have reinvented themselves into medical and science regions; same as Cleveland."</a></p>
        <p>Initial reports, including the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/05/here-are-the-us-metro-areas-with-the-best-and-worst-job-markets.html">interactive graphic from CSNBC</a> shown below reflect positive changes in the Midwestern economy. Unemployment rates almost universally declined in the Midwest between 2017 and 2018. Chicago's unemployment rate declined an astounding 21%, and Cleveland and Indianapolis's unemployment rates declined 5% and 7% respectively. Hopefully this trend continues!</p>

        <h2>New York's Startup Scene as Diverse as Its Population</h2>
        <p>By many measures, New York is the most cosmopolitan city in America. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/queens-languages-map-2017-2">There are over 800 languages spoken in Queens alone</a>, making it the most linguistically diverse region in the world! One area in which New York is well known for its diversity is in the job market. Unlike other major American cities like San Francisco or Los Angeles which seem to be dominated by the tech and entertainment industries respectively, there's a wide variety of industries in New York City. Careers in theater, fashion, finance, technology, and real estate are all common.</p>
        <p>It comes as no surprise that New York City's startup scene is equally diverse. Borrowing from their rich history in the city, some of the most overrepresented industries in New York's startup scene include fashion, real estate, and risk management. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-27/new-york-will-never-be-silicon-valley-and-it-s-good-with-that">Director of Tech:NYC Julie Sandals thinks</a> this is one of the things that makes the New York startup scene so unique: "Whereas companies like Google, Facebook and Amazon invented, developed and dominated entire new industries like internet advertising and e-commerce, the next wave of major tech companies are disrupting long-standing industries with a strong presence in New York, such as finance and healthcare." <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-27/new-york-will-never-be-silicon-valley-and-it-s-good-with-that">Ryan Williams CEO of real estate investment firm Cadre says</a>, "We wouldn't have been able to start our company with this scale anywhere other than New York," citing the proximity to major banking, private equity, and hedge fund customers.</p>
        <p>One of the highest-raising New York startups in 2018 was fashion startup <a href="https://www.renttherunway.com/">Rent the Runway</a>. In August, CEO Jennifer Hyman announced a $200M funding round <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/rent-the-runway#section-overview">bringing the company to a cumulative $416M raised</a>. Jennifer Hyman and Co-Founder Jenny Fleiss founded Rent the Runway to offer women an opportunity to rent a party appropriate outfit at an affordable price rather than buying a dress they might only wear once.</p>
        <p>Julie Sandals and some women coworkers also emphasize that a unique aspect of New York's startup scene is its focus on fostering women's inclusion. "New York is a much better place for fostering women entrepreneurs and women in tech," <a href="new york startup scene">she says</a>. Jennifer Hyman, who has now been CEO of Rent the Runway for coming on ten years, has something to say about this. In July <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/01/success/rent-the-runway-ceo-interview/index.html">she made headlines</a> for extending full maternity leave benefits to all employees of her company despite increased costs. She cited her own experience giving birth as the reason for her change of heart.</p>
        <p>The number of tech jobs in New York City <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-27/new-york-will-never-be-silicon-valley-and-it-s-good-with-that">have grown 30% in the past 10 years</a>, and today the city is only second to San Francisco in venture capital funding. As the New York tech industry matures the city is carving out its own place in the technology ecosystem.</p>
        <h2>Washington D.C. Exports Cybersecurity</h2>
        <p>In mid-2018, <a href="https://www.americaninno.com/dc/funding-dc/the-10-top-funded-cybersecurity-companies-in-the-d-c-metro-area/">the Commerce Department’s National Institute of Cybersecurity Education reported</a> that there were over 71,000 jobs filled in the security industry in the D.C. area and an additional 40,000 jobs on the market. Between 2011 and 2014, <a href="https://www.americaninno.com/dc/funding-dc/the-10-top-funded-cybersecurity-companies-in-the-d-c-metro-area/">three startup acquisitions in the D.C. area alone</a> totaled over $4B. The industry investment in the D.C. area has led to an increased demand for cybersecurity professionals and an influx of security engineers. <a href="https://www.csoonline.com/article/3214184/security-awareness/350-more-cybersecurity-pros-in-washington-dc-area-than-rest-of-us.html">DataTribe estimates</a> that the pool of security engineers in Washington D.C. is 350% larger than the rest of the United States <b><i>combined</i></b>.</p>
        <p>Recent Crunchbase investment data is proof that the secury industry in D.C. isn't slowing. In May, D.C.-based <a href="https://www.virtru.com/">Virtru</a> announced a $37.5M Series B funding round including seven investors. Founded in 2012, Virtru aims to provide trustworthy data management services to companies that don't force a choice between security and usability. In July, the company <a href="https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2018/07/25/1542123/0/en/Virtru-Teams-with-Google-to-Bring-End-to-End-Encryption-to-Google-Drive.html">announced a partnership with Google</a> where they will bring end-to-end encryption technology to Google Drive.</p>
        <p>Other investment in the cybersecurity industry in Washington comes from our federal government. The United States' annual defense budget totals $716B, and the Defense Department is interested in hiring cybersecurity engineers to ensure their systems are state of the art. Since demand so far outpaces supply of these industry experts, <a href="https://news.clearancejobs.com/2019/01/02/demand-for-it-pros-in-washington-metro-continues-to-outpace-supply/">the unemployment rate for cybersecurity engineers in Washington D.C. trends towards zero</a>. The Defense Department's battle to recruit quality security talent in the D.C. area may grow even tougher with the opening of the new Amazon headquarters in the D.C. metro area.</p>
        <h2>The Mile High City</h2>
        <p>The legalization of recreational cannabis in Colorado has led to some interesting and unique business challenges. Despite the fact that the drug is legal locally, the federal prohibition allows the government to prosecute businesses that operate across state borders and aid in the sale of marijuana. As a response, there's been a green rush of ancillary marijuana companies: companies that are adjacent to the cannabis industry but keep their operations above water. <a href="https://www.cannabisbusinessexecutive.com/2017/09/cbe-2017-top-150-cannabis-ancillary-businesses/">Forty-one of the top 150 ancilliary cannabis companies</a> are located in Colorado.</p>
        <p>Ancilliary cannabis businesses are diverse in their offerings. Since credit unions are often state-chartered in contrast with banks' federal designation, <a href="https://www.ironprotectiongroupsecurity.com/">Iron Protection Group</a> and <a href="https://www.bluelineprotectiongroup.com/">Blue Line Protection Group</a> are two credit unions that have popped up to serve cannabis businesses. Campaigns to heavily tax cannabis sales have closely followed legalization efforts nationwide, so Denver-based firms <a href="https://mjfreeway.com/">MJ Freeway</a> and <a href="https://flowhub.com/">Flowhub</a> specialize in tracking cannabis inventory to help companies comply with local tax regulations. Since cannabis was recently legalized, there's a deficit of qualified workers to meet the industry's demands, not to mention the stigma of working in the cannabis industry. Denver-based company <a href="https://www.vangst.com/">Vangst</a> works specifically as a recruiting firm for cannabis companies.</p>
        <p>Some good news for the Denver cannabis industry is that all signs point to other states following in Colorado's footsteps and expanding recreational cannabis. Today <a href="https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/a21719186/all-states-that-legalized-weed-in-us/">10 states and Washington D.C.</a> have legalized recreational marijuana, and an additional 23 states allow for medical marijuana. <a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201811/hannah-wallace/cannabis-business-growth-future.html">New Frontier estimates</a> that if cannabis were legalized in 50 states, the industry could employ as many as 1 million Americans by the year 2025. It's possible that this Denver-based industry will get a big break for being aheda of the game on this front.</p>
        <div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div>
        <p>As venture capital continues to expand to new markets in the United States, we will continue to see cities put their own spin on tech culture. Michael Mandel of the Progressive Policy Institute <a href="http://technet.org/blog/how-the-startup-economy-is-spreading-across-the-country">released a paper in 2017</a> in which he attempts to use growth in job postings containing the word "startup" to predict future venture capital investment in a city with some success. If his findings hold, we can expect Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Portland, and Dallas to join San Francisco, New York, and Seattle as tech giants in the coming years. We'll have to wait and see how these metros inevitably transform the startup landscape.</p>
